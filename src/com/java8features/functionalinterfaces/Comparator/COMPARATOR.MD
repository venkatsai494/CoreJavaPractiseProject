# Comparator

Comparator is a Functional Interface in Java which is used in defining the Custom ordering for objects


**Custom Sorting Order**: With a Comparator, you can define how objects should be sorted according to specific criteria. This allows flexibility in sorting objects based on attributes that are not directly comparable using their inherent ordering.<br>
**Non-Intrusive Sorting**: Unlike the Comparable interface, which modifies the class itself to provide a default ordering, Comparator allows sorting without altering the class being sorted. This is especially useful when you cannot modify the class's source code or when multiple different sorting criteria are needed.<br>
