### **Difference Between `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` in Java**

|            Feature           |                                        String                                        |                              StringBuilder                              |                           StringBuffer                          |
|:----------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Mutability                   | Immutable                                                                            | Mutable                                                                 | Mutable                                                         |
| Thread Safety                | Thread-safe due to immutability                                                      | Not thread-safe                                                         | Thread-safe (methods are synchronized)                          |
| Performance                  | Slower due to object creation overhead                                               | Faster (no synchronization)                                             | Slower (synchronization overhead)                               |
| Usage in Selenium Automation | Useful for storing and passing test data, but inefficient for frequent modifications | Best for dynamically constructing test data, URLs, or XPath expressions | Rarely needed, unless working in a multithreaded test execution |

### **When to Use?**

*   Use **`StringBuffer`** when working with **multithreading** and thread safety is needed.
*   Use **`StringBuilder`** when working with **a single thread** for better performance.

### **Example**

```java
public class StringExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using StringBuffer (Thread-safe)
        StringBuffer sbf = new StringBuffer("Hello");
        sbf.append(" World");
        System.out.println("StringBuffer: " + sbf);

        // Using StringBuilder (Faster)
        StringBuilder sbd = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        sbd.append(" World");
        System.out.println("StringBuilder: " + sbd);
    }
}
```

### **Key Takeaways**

*   `StringBuffer` is **synchronized**, making it **thread-safe** but slower.
*   `StringBuilder` is **not synchronized**, making it **faster** but not thread-safe.
*   Both are **mutable** alternatives to `String`, which is immutable.


### **Mnemonic**
I remember the difference between buffer and builder as folow using some mnemonics:

*   **"Buffer means the YouTube video is buffering"** â†’ The user has to **wait** ðŸ•’ (like synchronization in `StringBuffer`), ensuring thread safety but slowing things down.
*   **"Builder means we have to keep building fast"** â†’ Builder does not wait for anything he can do things in parallel like slab work and wall work, just **speed** ðŸš€ (like `StringBuilder`), but without thread safety.
